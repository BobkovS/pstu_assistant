124;RANG;Please tell me if by law, all entrants are equal, and recommended for admission will be students with the highest number of points, then why do students go to the two lists submitted, and no certificates, and the rating by the number of points for the latter is not even considered. All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others? Thus it is difficult to judge whether we have chance or not. Please make a General list, if reception conditions for all equal, as You say.
125;RANG;That is,if I wasn't in the recommended list,I decided to file the original in the second wave,did not enroll,although I,for example,200 points on the exam,because someone brought the original 1-wave in the free space with,for example,120 points?
126;RANG;Dmitry, tell me, say I want to go to the POS and ATMO. POS is a priority for me. But I'm afraid I pass on it, since I have a total of 182 points, and the pass was 188 last year.. On ECMO ,I think, has to go through. So, there is a possibility to try himself in the second wave on the POS, but if you still won't be there in the second wave,it is possible to stay on ECMO? Because statement-2 is indicated 1, the faculty, and I want to POS(even in the second wave), but if anything, ATMO go, to not stay with empty hands))
127;RANG;Thanks) As I understand it, the second wave is better not to wait, and to apply for Atma as POS 0 chance to pass?? And also, can I transfer then to the United ATMO POS? many of these cases in the Miata?))
128;RANG;Hello, I submitted the originals to atmo and would like to do with the hostel,statements 2 I said I need 167 points at the moment, I am still with the list, I have a question can I participate in the admission process if I will not get into the hostel and the school budget pass?
129;RANG;Hello. And the second wave in the Miata would not be?
130;ORG;Hello, please tell me, will it be possible later to move from faculty prit na MP or POS, if there are empty seats?

133;RANG;Hello! Tell me,this year the wave will continue till the 25th of July,ie the results of the income I after 25?
134;RANG;Hello.All day today I tried to call the admissions office and could not.If submitting originals I'll leave two options Заявления2 POS and ATMO and on the website you will see that POS already and will not pass through can not will take into account my second statement automatically?And is there any chance for me to get to POS at 199 points?
135;RANG;Good day! That's all there is to read, and there are still some misunderstandings. I passed the documents in 5 different Universities. Everywhere I'm still in reserve,but I hope that I'll get in the second wave. Do I have to submit the originals in one of the universities where I have more chances to pass?
